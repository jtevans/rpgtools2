# rpgtools2

This is the second iteration of my RPG tools. You can find the deployed, original version here: https://jtevans.kilnar.com/rpg/dnd/tools/

I think I'm done with this entire feature set for this version of the tools. As I have new ideas for new features (or if people request new features), I'll add them to this codebase.

This version has a React frontend with a PHP backend. The data files are the same between this repo and what is found here: https://github.com/jtevans/rpgtools

The original code is all in PHP, and that repo is here: https://github.com/jtevans/rpgtools

PS: I originally wrote MANY of these features in Pascal under DOS back in the early 1990s. This was prior to my discovery of the World Wide Web, and WELL BEFORE the creation of PHP. Alas, I've lost that Pascal code to the ages, but I still have these projects that live on.
