# rpgtools2

This is the second iteration of my RPG tools. Once I have the feature set completed to align with the features found at https://jtevans.kilnar.com/rpg/dnd/tools/, I'll push this version up to my web site as well.

For now, this is entirely in dev mode, and may or may not function properly. I do my best not to push broken, untested code to the repo, though.

This version has a React frontend with a PHP backend. The data files are the same between this repo and what is found here: https://github.com/jtevans/rpgtools

The original code is all in PHP, and that repo is here: https://github.com/jtevans/rpgtools

PS: I originally wrote MANY of these features in Pascal under DOS back in the early 1990s. This was prior to my discovery of the World Wide Web, and WELL BEFORE the creation of PHP. Alas, I've lost that Pascal code to the ages, but I still have these projects that live on.
