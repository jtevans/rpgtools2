10' deep pit filled with 3 1/2 feet of water.

When the party is in the middle of the hallway/room, someone steps on a moveable stone, and caltrops drop from the ceiling to cover the entire hallway/room.

A stone in the ceiling suddenly slides down 2 feet and stops.

A panel in the floor opens, and drops the party down a chute to land on some rotted hay. No damage is done, but waiting monsters will be able to surprise the party.

The hinges on a door have rotted away, and when a character tries to pull the door open, the door falls on him instead. This causes 1d4 points of damage, and pins him unless he has a strength of 11 or greater. Other party members may assist the trapped character, of course.

While walking through a tight hallway, an invisible glass globe falls from the ceiling and shatters. A thick, harmless fog fills the hallway until the characters can devise of a way to remove it.

When the party enters the room a heavy portculis drops behind them. They will have to make a successful bend bars/lift gates roll or find another way around it. After 5 hours time, the gate opens on its own, unless the bars are bent.

A teleporter pad takes the party to a different portion of the dungeon. They will not notice any effect. If monsters are waiting at the receiving end, then the characters perceive that these monsters appear out of thin air. (Makes mapping more fun this way!)

A trigger to open a secret door is recessed inside a hole. Nothing can seem to get a grip in the release except for a finger. Once a character has it the release he realizes that he can't get his finger out due to a Chinese Finger Trap. Of course, the secret door is opened now, and any bad-nasties inside the room are free to come out and annoy the party. A successful WIS check and 2 rounds will get the character out.
